# Pet-Tag-Scanner
building a pet ID scanner
after watching Andreas Spiess video trying to identify his cats with an RFID module.
I wanted to get the decimal tag number used by all the databases to identify animals.
the code being used ran into problems as the number is very large.
ie 215,000,123,456
